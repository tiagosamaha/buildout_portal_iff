Collage developer documentation
===============================

The Collage product was built to be easily customizable.

Content views
-------------

New content views can be added by registering a browser view with
a browser:page-directive. Examples of this can be found in::

  ./browser/views.zcml

A view for a standard document can be registered as follows::

  <browser:page
     name="my-view"
     for="Products.ATContentTypes.content.document.ATDocument"
     permission="zope.Public"
     template="my-view-template.pt"
     class=".document.MyDocumentView"
     layer="Products.Collage.interfaces.ICollageBrowserLayer"
     />

To display a human-readable title, we associate the view with the
following class, placed in a file document.py:::

  from Products.Five.browser import BrowserView

  class MyDocumentView(BrowserView):
      title = u'My view'


Skins views
-----------

New skins views can be added by registering a named utility in::

  MySkin/browser/skins.zcml

For example, a skin "Alert" for the view "my-view" can be registered
as follows::

  <utility
     name="collage-my-view-alert"
     provides="Products.Collage.interfaces.IAlertSkin"
     factory=".skins.PortletSkin03"
  />

To display a human-readable title, we associate the utility with the
following class, placed in a skins.py::

    from Products.MySkin import MyMessageFactory as _

    class PortletSkin03(object):
        title = _(u"skin-03", default=u"My portlet skin")

Add IAlertSkin in MySkin/interfaces.py::

    from zope import interface
    class IAlertSkin(interface.Interface):
	 """Interface for alert skins views."""

To associate this skin to a view, you must add the interfaces
implemented by the skin::

  class MyDocumentView(BrowserView):
      title = u'My view'
      skinInterfaces = (IAlertSkin,)

Note that you don't need this above stuff for portlets views
that are already skinnable.

Finally, add your CSS rules in a stylesheet::

  #collage .collage-my-view-alert {
   ...

  }

Note that if you are using "Merge CSS composition" of CSS registry,
your stylesheet must be after "collage.css" and use the same condition
as the former::

  object/@@collage|nothing


Content controls
----------------

Content controls are registered as viewlets. See
./browser/viewlets.zcml for examples.
